    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I implement Self-RAG, an advanced RAG system that dynamically decides when and how to use retrieved information. Unlike traditional RAG approaches, Self-RAG introduces reflection points throughout the retrieval and generation process, resulting in higher quality and more reliable responses.\n",

    "## Key Components of Self-RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieval Decision**: Determines if retrieval is even necessary for a given query\n",
    "2. **Document Retrieval**: Fetches potentially relevant documents when needed  \n",
    "3. **Relevance Evaluation**: Assesses how relevant each retrieved document is\n",
    "4. **Response Generation**: Creates responses based on relevant contexts\n",
    "5. **Support Assessment**: Evaluates if responses are properly grounded in the context\n",
